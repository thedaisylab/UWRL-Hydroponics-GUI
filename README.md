# Hydroponic System Image App (NiceGUI + Render deployment version)

This desktop app allows you to crop, timelapse, and mask plant images using NiceGUI and OpenCV.

To run this app correctly, the best way to do so is first upload some images a set of images
to crop. About 12 images is good. Once those images are uploaded, and you press the button to crop, the first image will appear at the top of the page. Click four points to crop the image to ONE PLANT, and all uploaded images (again, of one plant) will be downloaded to the browser. Save images to your computer and open zip file. 

Then, reload the app to work use the other buttons. 

Timelapse: Upload the cropped images and click the timelapse button. You will get a cool timelapse video of your plant growing saved to your desktop. 

Masking/growth charts: Make sure the cropped images are the uploaded images (reload page if necessary). In order to use the growth chart button, you must first make the masks of the images (which are just a black and white version of the plant). Then masks will be downloaded to the browser, save to computer and unzip. Reload the page, and upload the masks. Then you can click the growth code! A zip file with a growth graph will be downloaded to the browser. Save to desktop, unzip, and the graph will appear on the desktop!
